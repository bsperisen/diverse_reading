After surviving the grand tragedy of the Busan Fire that leaves 28,000 people homeless, Nara leaves the squalid tent city that had become her home and is thrown headlong into a new life in Vancouver, Canada, where she elucidates the poetry of home.

In 1941, after having identified ololiuqui, the long-lost Aztec hallucinogen, and having collected the first specimens of teonanacatl, the sacred mushroom of Mexico, Schultes took a leave of absence from Harvard and disappeared into the Northwest Amazon of Colombia. Twelve years later, he returned from South America, having gone places no outsider had ever been, mapping uncharted rivers and living among two dozen Indian tribes. He collected some twenty thousand botanical specimens, including three hundred species new to science, and documented the invaluable knowledge of native shamans. The world's leading authority on plant hallucinogens, Schultes was for his students a living link to a distant time when the tropical rain forests stood immense, inviolable, a mantle of green stretching across entire continents.

More than a collection of tales, the reader learns about the lives of the story-tellers and their history, their spiritual traditions, adaptation to the environment, relationships with animals, and sense of humour. Outsiders to the culture have long focused on the physical artifacts of shamanism - like the costume and drum - and on ritual healing practices, but far less is known about the images shamans and storytellers use to entertain, heal, and educate. Van Deusen describes the lives of the people of the Amur during a period of dramatic transition, as they attempt to find some way to relate ancient traditions to an uncertain future. She emphasizes the contributions of women - often overlooked in the literature on shamanism - in traditional and contemporary society, and their concerns with ecology and the education of children. Their magnificent embroidery, illustrated by the author's photographs, echoes these women's stories. The Flying Tiger will appeal to anyone interested in shamanism, storytelling and folklore, Russia, indigenous people, women's studies, and spirituality."], "author": "Kira Van Deusen", "num_pages": "280", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2001-01-29 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0773521569"},

In one of the most miraculous events of the century, the oppressive system of apartheid was dismantled. Repressive laws mandating separation of the races were thrown out. The country, which had been carved into a crazy quilt that reserved the most prosperous areas for whites and the most desolate and backward for blacks, was reunited. The dreaded and dangerous security force, which for years had systematically tortured, spied upon, and harassed people of color and their white supporters, was dismantled. But how could this country--one of spectacular beauty and promise--come to terms with its ugly past? How could its people, whom the oppressive white government had pitted against one another, live side by side as friends and neighbors?", "To begin the healing process, Nelson Mandela created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by the renowned cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Established in 1995, the commission faced the awesome task of hearing the testimony of the victims of apartheid as well as the oppressors. Amnesty was granted to those who offered a full confession of any crimes associated with apartheid. Since the commission began its work, it has been the central player in a drama that has riveted the country. In this book, Antjie Krog, a South African journalist and poet who has covered the work of the commission, recounts the drama, the horrors, the wrenching personal stories of the victims and their families.

Thus the question of authority \u2013 political, social, sexual and religious \u2013 forms the thematic core of the book, with (female) sexuality receiving the lion\u2019s share of concern. Political authority is manifest in the emphasis in many stories on the machinations of the police state \u2013 arbitrary arrest and detention, interrogations, corruption. Social authority expresses itself in the patriarchal cultural order and dominance of religious and cultural institutions and conventions that constrain individual freedom. Many stories stress religious hypocrisy and the unfilled sexual expectations of women. In bringing together religion, politics and sexuality (sometimes all three in the same story), the author is telling us indirectly that these forms of oppression are all connected.

Peter Allison gives us the guide's-eye view of living in the bush, confronting the world's fiercest terrain of wild animals and, most challenging of all, managing herds of gaping tourists. Passionate for the animals of the Kalahari, Allison works as a top safari guide in the wildlife-rich Okavango Delta. As he serves the whims of his wealthy clients, he often has to stop the impulse to run as far away from them as he can, as these tourists are sometimes more dangerous than a pride of lions. No one could make up these outrageous-but-true tales: the young woman who rejected the recommended safari-friendly khaki to wear a more \"fashionable\" hot pink ensemble; the lost tourist who happened to be drunk, half-naked, and a member of the British royal family; establishing a real friendship with the continent's most vicious animal; the Japanese tourist who requested a repeat performance of Allison's being charged by a lion so he could videotape it; and spending a crazy night in the wild after blowing a tire on a tour bus, revealing that Allison has as much good-natured scorn for himself. The author's humor is exceeded only by his love and respect for the animals, and his goal is to limit any negative exposure to humans by planning trips that are minimally invasive--unfortunately it doesn't always work out that way!

She is a Catholic, but open to an unorthodox belief in \u201cnatural priesthood\u201d and other \u201cways of knowing\u201d such as shamanism. As such, she wants to use her immense wealth, her Spanish titles and her son\u2019s future role in the British House of Lords, to make restitution to the Indians of all the Americas from the Arctic to the Antarctic.", "In his attempt to cope, the intelligent and sensitive young Rupert creates his own secret world in the woodlands of his father\u2019s estate in Oxfordshire, complete with a tipi and an imaginary Indian blood brother.", "In 1982, while an undergraduate at Oxford, Rupert encounters Clearvoice, an 82-year-old Cree Indian \u201ctroublemaker\u201d who has come to England to meet the \u201cWhite Queen\u201d.

His visit is also the fulfilment of a Vision Quest dream he experienced when he was sixteen years of age.", "As Rupert emerges into manhood, his search for an authentic role in the midst of these conflicting cosmologies is complicated by a corrupt official at the Canadian embassy in London whose scheming triggers a chain of shocking events that forces Rupert to re-evaluate all his beliefs and loyalties.", "The story of the novel also features a Blackfoot-Cree Holy Woman from Alberta and a Jesuit with Christian-Marxist tendencies from Seville. All these complex characters are swept up in mystery and suspense by a plot that twists and turns until the last page. Although it is a modern story, the first four chapters include references to more than a hundred years of relations between Britain and the Indian nations told from both points of view.", "Set mainly in 1982-85 in England, Canada and Spain, it is fiction inspired by fact in a rich mixture of politics, religion, family and tribe. It demonstrates how the search for personal identity and integrity can play a vital role in nation-building.", "The novel is unusually long because it is two books in one. Book 1 consists of four chapters in which the main characters transport the reader into their four quite different cosmologies.

And Skeletons at the Feast chronicled the last six months of World War Two in Poland and Germany with nail-biting authenticity. As The Washington Post Book World has noted, Bohjalian writes \u201cthe sorts of books people stay awake all night to finish.\u201d", "In his fifteenth book, The Sandcastle Girls, he brings us on a very different kind of journey. This spellbinding tale travels between Aleppo, Syria, in 1915 and Bronxville, New York, in 2012\u2014a sweeping historical love story steeped in the author\u2019s Armenian heritage, making it his most personal novel to date.", "When Elizabeth Endicott arrives in Syria, she has a diploma from Mount Holyoke College, a crash course in nursing, and only the most basic grasp of the Armenian language. The First World War is spreading across Europe, and she has volunteered on behalf of the Boston-based Friends of Armenia to deliver food and medical aid to refugees of the Armenian genocide. There, Elizabeth becomes friendly with Armen, a young Armenian engineer who has already lost his wife and infant daughter. When Armen leaves Aleppo to join the British Army in Egypt, he begins to write Elizabeth letters, and comes to realize that he has fallen in love with the wealthy, young American woman who is so different from the wife he lost.Flash forward to the present, where we meet Laura Petrosian, a novelist living in suburban New York. Although her grandparents\u2019 ornate Pelham home was affectionately nicknamed the \u201cOttoman Annex,\u201d Laura has never really given her Armenian heritage much thought. But when an old friend calls, claiming to have seen a newspaper photo of Laura\u2019s grandmother promoting an exhibit at a Boston museum, Laura embarks on a journey back through her family\u2019s history that reveals love, loss\u2014and a wrenching secret that has been buried for generations."], "author": "Chris Bohjalian", "num_pages": "321", "awards": [], "places": ["Syria"], "character_names": ["Elizabeth Endicott", "Armen Petrosian", "Nevart", "Hatoun", "Dr. Sayied Akcam"], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2012-07-17 00:00:00"},

But while these workers, who leave their rural towns to find jobs in China's cities, are the driving force behind China's growing economy, little is known about their day-to-day lives or the sociological significance of this massive movement. In Factory Girls, Leslie T. Chang tells the story of these workers primarily through the lives of two young women whom she follows over the course of three years. Chang vividly portrays a world where you can lose your boyfriend and your friends with the loss of a cell phone; where lying about your age, your education, and your work experience is often a requisite for getting ahead; where a few computer or English lessons can catapult you into a completely different social class. Throughout this affecting portrait of migrant life, Chang also interweaves the story of her own family's migrations, within China and to the West, providing a historical frame of reference for her investigation. At a time when the Olympics will have shifted the world's focus to China, Factory Girls offers a previously untold story about the immense population of unknown women who work countless hours, often in hazardous conditions, to provide us with the material goods we take for granted.
